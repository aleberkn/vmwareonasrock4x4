# vmware on asrock4x4 
 we are using the asrock 4800 with ryzen 7 and realtek nics \
 need to modify esxi installation by adding drivers for realtek nics \
 esxi7+ no longer support vmkernel so the realtek drivers can only be added to versions prior to esxi7 \
 we are using esxi6.5 on the asrock 4800 \
